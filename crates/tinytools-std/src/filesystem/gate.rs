//! The host's say over every filesystem tool call.
//!
//! The tools in this module read, write, search and patch files, but they do
//! not decide what they are *allowed* to touch. That decision (an autonomy
//! level, a workspace boundary, an approval prompt, an hourly action budget,
//! credential stores that are never reachable) belongs to the host whose threat
//! model and configuration it depends on. A tool asks an [`FsGate`] instead.
//!
//! The trait is exactly the set of questions the tools put to a policy, and
//! nothing wider: it carries no decision *types* of its own, only booleans and
//! resolved paths, so a host maps its own policy onto it without translating a
//! vocabulary.
